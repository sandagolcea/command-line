grep <expression> [file]

grep command searches through the input for the <expression> and returns all the strings that match it.

Use wildcards to enhance your search:
* - replaces any number of random characters.
^A - finds all strings that start with A.

My favorite grep command is:
grep -lr "string_search" *
This grep finds a string in all directory files and subfolders.

Options:
-s - silent mode (does not list files it can't access etc)
-v - invert match (returns all those NOT matching your <expression> )
-c - counts lines and returns number
-r / -R - recursive search
-i - ignore case
-e - egrep or enhanced grep ( more for regular expressions)
-l - only list name of file

Examples:
$ grep 'path' myfile //searches for the word path in myfile
$ grep '^\.Pa' myfile //searches all words that start with .Pa.. in myfile
$ grep -v -e 'foo' -e 'bar' myfile //returns all the lines in myfile that do NOT contain foo or bar
$ egrep '1|2|3' myfile //returns all the lines that contain 1,2 or 3
$ egrep -r 'content' . //searches curr dir(.) recursively(-r) to find 'content'
$ grep 'COLOR' .* -s //searches string COLOR in all the hidden files of curr dir (default) in silent mode
$ grep -lir "sometext" . //recursively list only the name of the file that contains string sometext
